    "# Synthetic Conversation Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "When building an AI-powered chatbot, it's often helpful to have a large number of realistic conversations between a human and the AI\n",
    "for testing purposes. Given the conversation up until a point, you can verify whether your AI responds as expected to the latest\n",
    "user message.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a conversation with three conversation turns (i.e. the user and AI have responded to each other 3 times), then you\n",
    "can simulate how changes to the AI system effect the AI's respond on turn 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are two problems with this.\n",
    "1. Collecting a large number of realistic conversations can be tricky, making it difficult to simulate your Chatbot's behavior over a wide variety of real-world scenarios; and\n",
    "2. While you can simulate the _most recent_ AI message, you cannot easily test changes that would have affected the AI's _messages up until that point_.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve for both of these problems, this guide shows you how you can use two Vellum Workflows to \"talk to\" one another and generate a wide set of synthetic conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One Workflow represents the AI Chatbot itself, and the other represents a user chatting into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes the following pre-requisites:\n",
    "1. You have a Vellum account and have created a Vellum API key\n",
    "2. You know how to run and interact with a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "3. You've created a **Vellum Workflow representing your AI chatbot** that accepts a `CHAT_HISTORY` input variable called `chat_history`. It should have a Final Output Node of type `STRING` called `final-output`.\n",
    "4. You've created another **Vellum Workflow representing your user** that accepts a `CHAT_HISTORY` input variable called `chat_history`. It should have a Final Output Node of type `STRING` called `final-output`.\n",
    "5. You've already done manual testing on your User Workflow to ensure that it behaves similarly to your customers.\n",
    "6. You've updated the csv file located at `datasets/seed_user_messages.csv`. There's one row per conversation you want to generate, and one initial or \"seed\" user message per conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "In the rest of this guide, we'll implement everything needed to generate sythetic conversations that could then be uploaded into a Vellum Test Suite for quantitative evaluation of conversation quality."
